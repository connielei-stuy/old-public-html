First, I connected to 149.89.151.101 and then entered my public_html folder. From there, I created the file system as indicated in the HW using commands such as mkdir <name>, touch <name> and mv <name> <name> as well as using cd to navigate my way around my folders. For my homepage, I created an index.html file and then added a head area to add change the title of my webpage to Connie's Homepage. Then I added four links to the folders of my respective HWs. </p>
<p> In order to calculate the number of unique IP(v4) addresses, you know there are 256 digits per each section and there are four sections. You would need to multiply 256 by itself four times so you can just write it as 256 to the fourth power, which will result in around 4.3 billion unique IP addresses.</p>
